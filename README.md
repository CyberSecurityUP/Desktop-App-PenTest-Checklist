#### **1. Initial Reconnaissance**
- [ ] Identify the target operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- [ ] Identify the application architecture (32/64-bit).
- [ ] Identify the programming language used (e.g., C++, .NET, Java).
- [ ] List external dependencies (DLLs, libraries, frameworks).
- [ ] Verify permissions and privileges required for execution.
- [ ] Inspect public documentation (user manuals, help files, changelogs).
- [ ] Identify prior versions and known vulnerabilities (CVEs).

#### **2. Reverse Engineering**
##### **Static Analysis**
- [ ] Extract and analyze the main binary.
- [ ] Identify sensitive strings (passwords, APIs, tokens) using **strings** or **Binwalk**.
- [ ] Identify dependencies with tools like **Dependency Walker** or **Ghidra**.
- [ ] Review compilation settings (enabled/disabled protections such as ASLR, DEP, SafeSEH).
- [ ] Decompile binaries using tools like **IDA Pro**, **Ghidra**, or **dnSpy** (.NET).
- [ ] Extract and analyze embedded resources (icons, images, scripts).
- [ ] Identify critical functions: authentication, access control, encryption.

##### **Dynamic Analysis**
- [ ] Debug the application at runtime using tools like **x64dbg**, **WinDbg**, or **OllyDbg**.
- [ ] Observe control flows (critical functions, loops, system calls).
- [ ] Monitor network traffic with **Wireshark** or **Fiddler**.
- [ ] Map runtime events (file access, memory usage, registry keys).

#### **3. Vulnerability Testing**
##### **Input Validation**
- [ ] Test input fields with long strings to identify buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Check how the application handles unexpected inputs (e.g., special characters, invalid encodings).
- [ ] Perform fuzzing on input fields using tools like **Peach** or **AFL**.
- [ ] Test for command injection in fields interacting with system commands.
- [ ] Test for SQL Injection in forms or embedded database queries.

##### **File Handling**
- [ ] Verify if the application validates file names (path traversal).
- [ ] Test creating malicious files in monitored directories.
- [ ] Modify configuration files and observe behavior changes.
- [ ] Test corrupted or malformed files.

##### **Memory Security**
- [ ] Inspect sensitive data stored in memory (passwords, API keys).
- [ ] Use tools like **Mimikatz** or **Volatility** for memory analysis.
- [ ] Verify protection against buffer overflow (stack canaries, DEP, ASLR).

##### **Authentication and Authorization**
- [ ] Check if credentials are stored locally.
- [ ] Verify session persistence mechanisms (cookies, tokens).
- [ ] Attempt to bypass authentication checks using reverse engineering.
- [ ] Test privilege escalation locally.

#### **4. Network and Communication**
- [ ] Capture traffic generated by the application with **Wireshark** or **tcpdump**.
- [ ] Inspect API or remote service communication with **Burp Suite**.
- [ ] Verify encrypted communication (TLS, SSL).
- [ ] Test for sensitive data interception via reverse proxy.
- [ ] Identify hidden endpoints and exposed routes.

#### **5. Security Bypass**
- [ ] Test for anti-debugging mechanisms.
- [ ] Bypass signed DLL validation checks.
- [ ] Verify code obfuscation and attempt to deobfuscate.
- [ ] Inspect and disable checksum verifications in binaries.

#### **6. Persistence**
- [ ] Analyze temporary files and logs created by the application.
- [ ] Verify registry key usage for storing data on Windows.
- [ ] Identify sensitive data in local or persistent storage.

#### **7. Privilege Escalation**
- [ ] Test application behavior when run as an administrator.
- [ ] Verify file and directory permissions used by the application.
- [ ] Exploit misconfigurations, such as writable files in protected directories.
- [ ] Test malicious DLL/process injection.

#### **8. Advanced Exploitation**
- [ ] Create custom payloads to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Inject shellcode into application memory.
- [ ] Explore malicious DLL injection techniques.
- [ ] Investigate interdependent processes with **ProcMon** and **Process Explorer**.

#### **9. System Protections**
- [ ] Verify ASLR, DEP, and other protections in the executable.
- [ ] Test the effectiveness of digital signatures and integrity checks.
- [ ] Identify sandboxing or security containerization mechanisms.

#### **10. Reporting**
- [ ] Document each vulnerability with:
  - [ ] Detailed description.
  - [ ] Potential impact.
  - [ ] Steps to reproduce.
  - [ ] Proof-of-concept.
  - [ ] Mitigation recommendations.
- [ ] Generate a consolidated report with executive and technical summaries.
